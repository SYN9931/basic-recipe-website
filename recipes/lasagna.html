    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oven-ready lasagna</li>
        <li>basil</li>
        <li>parmesan</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>mushroom</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>ricotta</li>
        <li>sausage</li>
        <li>marinara</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Prep the Ingredients</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Italian sausage in olive oil, stirring to break it up, until no longer pink. Drain as much grease from the pan as possible and return the pan to the heat. Add the garlic, salt and the pepper. Cook and stir for another minute or two and then remove the pan from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the ricotta, egg, salt, and chopped basil to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix it well and set it aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><h4>Assemble the Lasagna</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly coat the bottom of a deep, freezer safe 13- x 9-inch pan with marinara sauce. Place 4 lasagna sheets over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spoon ⅓ of the ricotta mixture over the lasagna sheets and spread it out evenly with a knife.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle ⅓ of the cooked sausage over the ricotta. Top with ⅓ of the chopped mushrooms, purposely allowing some to fill in edges of the pan around the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <li><h4>Freeze the Lasagna</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat the bottom of a sheet of heavy duty foil generously with nonstick cooking spray and place it, coated side down, over the baking dish. This will help prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Then, wrap the pan in another sheet or two of heavy duty foil and its ready for the freezer.</li>
            <li>Write the contents and the date on the foil with a permanent marker.</li>

        </ol>

        <li><h4>How to cook Frozen lasagna</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooking from frozen</strong> - Bake lasagna straight from the freezer covered with foil for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to cook for an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until cooked through and the internal temperature of the center portion reaches 165 degrees F with an instant read thermometer.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking thawed lasagna</strong> - Allow the homemade frozen lasagna to defrost completely in the refrigerator overnight. Never allow frozen lasagna to thaw at room temperature. Bake at 375 degrees F, covered with foil, for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until bubbly and cooked through.</li>
        </ul>
