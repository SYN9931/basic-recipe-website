    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>mashed tofu</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>broccoli</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shake up sauce- You'll want to mix up the sauce before you begin cooking. In a small jar, add honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Shake it up, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook turkey- Heat a non stick pan over medium heat. Add the ground turkey to the pan, and cook for 7-10 minutes, stirring and breaking it up with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Garlic & ginger- When turkey is cooked through and no pink remains, make a space in the middle of the pan. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring a bit, for 1 minute. Then mix it right into the ground turkey.</li>
        <li>Sauce it up- Shake the sauce back up, then pour it evenly over the turkey. Let it cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbly and everything is coated in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Portion out- Portion out the ground turkey + sauce into 2 cup or larger meal prep containers with steamed broccoli and rice. Refrigerate for up to 4 days, and heat it up until steaming hot in the microwave to serve.</li>
        
    </ol>
